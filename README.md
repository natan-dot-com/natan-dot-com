## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Currently an undergraduate computer science student who's in love with playing with data and applying statistical models in it.

- ðŸŒ± My current research's about feature engineering and metalearning applied to the computational interpretation of gens, colaborating directly with [BioAutoML](https://github.com/Bonidia/BioAutoML).
- ðŸ“– My research interests lies in the area of Bio-Inspired Computing and Deep Learning.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about everything!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love reading every kind of books! I track all my reading activity with Goodreads, which can be found right above.

    About my mathematical mind... ðŸ’¡
  </summary>

#### Besides I'm not undergraduating in Mathematics, I still study maths as a hobby.

I used to love maths since when I was in High School. After getting into university I could say I met up what **real** maths is and then my interest in it just grew up! Almost all of my study moments in maths happen outside the university and I think it's doing really good for academic pourposes.

I could also point some of the areas I'm most interested in:
- General Statistics and Probability
- Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory
- Abstract and Linear Algebra


It's certainly the science field which gets me excited the most. :)
