    About my mathematical mind... 💡
  </summary>

#### Besides I'm not undergraduating in Mathematics, I still use maths as a hobby.

I used to love maths since when I was in High School. After getting into university, I could say I met up what **real** maths is and then my interest in it just grew up! Almost all of my study moments in maths happen outside the university and I think it's doing really good for academic pourposes.

I could also point some of the areas I'm most interested in:
- Multivariable Calculus and Real Analysis
- Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory
- Abstract and Linear Algebra
- General statistics

It's certainly the science field which gets me excited the most. :)
