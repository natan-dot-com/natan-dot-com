## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Currently an undergraduate computer science student who's in love with playing with data and applying statistical models in it.

- ðŸŒ± My current research is around Item Response Theory and its applications on Elementary/High School's exams, as a method of creating a general concept of an adaptative test exam using IRT parameters. 
- ðŸ˜„ As a developer, I've been working with Python, R (to work with data) and C++ (for general software development) the past few months.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about everything!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love learning new languages! Currently going forward with French and working on minor fixes with English. Thinking about improvement is really a nice thing. :)

    About my mathematical mind... ðŸ’¡
  </summary>

#### Besides I'm not undergraduating in Mathematics, I still study maths as a hobby.

I used to love maths since when I was in High School. After getting into university I could say I met up what **real** maths is and then my interest in it just grew up! Almost all of my study moments in maths happen outside the university and I think it's doing really good for academic pourposes.

I could also point some of the areas I'm most interested in:
- General Statistics and Probability
- Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory
- Abstract and Linear Algebra


It's certainly the science field which gets me excited the most. :)
